# Constant-time removals in Michael-Scott queue

In [`src/MSQueueWithConstantTimeRemove.kt`](src/MSQueueWithConstantTimeRemove.kt),
implement a Michael-Scott queue with an additional `remove(element)` operation.
The implementation should find the first node that contains the specified element
in linear time, but remove this node in _constant_ time.
